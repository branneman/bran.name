  <h1>Effective Meetings</h1>

  <p><p>I've compiled a list of what <em>I think</em> are best-practices around having effective meetings. This is probably incomplete, and it might be too opinionated, but I believe it's useful.</p>

<h2>Calendar software</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Either accept or decline meetings, make sure to respond reasonable quickly.</li>
  <li>When you respond with 'maybe', make sure its a temporary state, and you actually turn it into an accept or decline soon.</li>
  <li>When you decline a meeting, make sure you decline with a reason in the notes field.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attending a meeting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be on time, e.g. arrive in the first minute. Figure out your notifications if this is difficult for you.</li>
  <li>If you will be late, or if can't make it last-minute, send the organiser a message to notify them.</li>
  <li>Respect everybody, don't side-channel or second-screen, pay attention.</li>
  <li>Engage with the attendees, give direction by asking open questions instead of judgemental statements. Don't interrupt people. Always assume the most generous interpretation. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCcUMnj6EKE">Effective Communication</a> (12:19).</li>
  <li>When remote, turn on your camera and microphone (unless you have a lot of background noise, but even then there's apps for that).</li>
  <li>Stop on time, respect everybodyâ€™s time. This means mentioning 5 minutes before the end that it should end.</li>
  <li>Take notes, write down ideas and insights. The brain is good at having ideas, but very bad at storing ideas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Organising a meeting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Come up with a good title for the meeting, something every attendee will understand right away.</li>
  <li>Add a description to the invite, so attendees will know what the topic is, whether they are required or optional, and how to prepare themselves.</li>
  <li>When you are the organiser, you are (by default) expected to host it.</li>
  <li>If you will not host the meeting (but you are the organiser), specify in the description who will host it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hosting a meeting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce the context and goal of the meeting in the first 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>If you have a specific format (code walk, discussion, workshop, etc.) in mind, explain it to the attendees.</li>
  <li>Explain what you expect to get done with the group in the time you have available. What is the output?</li>
  <li>When you're half way the allotted time, casually mention the expected output again, so everybody stays conscious of time and the goal.</li>
  <li>Five minutes before the end, start to close the meeting by summarising: repeating the conclusions and decisions that were made.</li>
  <li>Assign actions to specific people and come up with deadlines to make sure they get done (task+name+date).</li>
</ul>

<h2>After a meeting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Read through your notes, add any other actions and insights you come up with.</li>
  <li>Decide on when you will do your actions, schedule time in your calendar if the task is large enough.</li>
</ul></p>
